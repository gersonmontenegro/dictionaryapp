App to use the translation service from the Oxford API dictionary using React Native

Now, I'm going to make a little experiment using the [Oxford dictionary API](https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com). It's free, at least in my purpose.

First of all, I need some scope in order to start this project, and the initial scope could have the next features:

 1. Splash screen.
 2. Main interface to search the meaning of a word.
 3. Show related words.
 4. Show different meanings.
 5. Show part of the speak.

I think is enough with that scope for now because I'm talking about a little project, but it's important for me to get a project that is able to scale with more options without struggling in the future with the base code.
